The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) provides the calculated physico-chemical properties of the parent chemical and transformation products, which are predicted as a function of the reaction system of interest.  This is accomplished through the integration of cheminformatics applications for the encoding of process science underlying transformation pathways, computational chemistry tools for the calculation of physico-chemical properties, and software technologies that provide access to on-line databases for environmental descriptors required for estimating environmental concentrations.
</p>
<p>
The CTS consists of 6 modules, the selection and order of execution of which is based on the userâ€™s choice of one of three available workflows:
</p>
<p>
<b>Chemical Editor (CE):</b>
Provides options for chemical entry, as well as the chemical speciationof the parent chemical
<br><br>
<b>Physicochemical Properties Calculator (PPC):</b>
Calculates p-chem properties for the parent chemical and predicted transformation products based on the executions of multiple p-chem calculators
<br><br>
<b>Earth Systems Model (ESM):</b>
Provides data mining abilities for environmental descriptors such as pH and temperature
<br><br>
<b>Reaction Pathway Simulator (RPS):</b>
Generates potential transformation products based on user-specified reaction conditions
<br><br>
<b>Structure-based Database (SBD):</b>
Populated with calculated and measured physico-chemical properties of parent and potential transformation products
<br><br>
<b>Reaction Rate Calculator (RRC):</b>
Calculates transformation products based on the parameritization and execution of QSARs and Algorithms
